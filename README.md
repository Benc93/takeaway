#End of Week 2 Challenge (Part 2) - Takeaway
   
##Briefing
   
Write a Takeaway app.  
   
Implement the following functionality:
+ List of dishes with prices.   
+ Placing the order by giving the list of dishes, their quantities and a number that should be the exact total. If the sum is not correct the method should raise an error, otherwise the customer is sent a text saying that the order was placed successfully and that it will be delivered 1 hour from now, e.g. "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52".
+ The text sending functionality should be implemented using Twilio API. You'll need to register for it. It’s free.
+ Use twilio-ruby gem to access the API
+ Use a Gemfile to manage your gems
+ Make sure that your Takeaway class is thoroughly tested and that you use mocks and/or stubs, as necessary to not to send texts when your tests are run
+ However, if your Takeaway class is loaded into IRB and the order is placed, the text should actually be sent
+ A free account on Twilio will only allow you to send texts to "verified" numbers. Use your mobile phone number, don't worry about the customer's mobile phone.


##Analysis
   
Based on the briefing - I identified the following classes: **Dish**, **Line_Item**, **Menu**, **Order**, **Customer**, **Restaurant**. 

The structure builds up from Dish class (given from the Menu class), into a Line Item, into an Order. The Order is compiled by the Customer class (built up using the Line Item class - where the correct totals are checked). The Customer sends the complete order to the Restaurant. At that point the Restaurant can send a text message to the customer as one of it's methods (in fact - the only method for the restaurant).
